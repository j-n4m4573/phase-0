		1.5 Tracking Changes Reflection


		## If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?  



		### To create a new repo I would have them click the plus sign in the upper right hand corner and select new repository, then name the repository, mark level of privacy, and choose wether they wanted to initialize the repository on github or on the remote, then click create. For forking I would have them click on the fork, then navigate to their personal github page to see if it completed. To clone I would have them navigate to the fork on there personal page and copy/double click the the address under http on the bottom right corner of the page.  



		## What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?   



		 ### I did not have any struggles setting up git and/or github, I was already slightly familiar with setting up, initializing and adding from a remote. What I learned through the process of setting everthing up was that github can be easy to use if you understand and remember the basics and ask or type help when you get stuck.    



		 ## How does tracking and adding changes make developers' lives easier?  


		 ### It makes developers lives easier first because it helps them to remember what has occured on the branch or master and it tracks what has been done and when it has been done, which is helpful if there is a problem or if for any reason they need to backtrack and go with an earlier version that worked better.   


		## What is a commit?
		### A commit is the transfering of files from the remote to the repository or possibly could be the opposite, after files are staged and ready to be added.   


		## What are the best practices for commit messages? 


		### The best practices are to use the first line as a subject line, like an email. And the proceeding lines should be a brief (under 72 characters) description about the work that needs to be carried out.   


		
		## What does the HEAD^ argument mean?
		The head argument means the last commit in the sequence.   


		### What are the 3 stages of a git change and how do you move a file from one stage to the other?
		The three stages of a git change are staging prepping and commiting . You move a file from one stage to the other by calling the commands on the command line.   


		## Write a handy cheatsheet of the commands you need to commit your changes?   

		
		### git status, git add, git ci -m  


		## What is a pull request and how do you create and merge one?
		A pull request is a request for your changes to be merged with the master repository.    
		


		## Why are pull requests preferred when working with teams?  


		### Pull request are preffered because they can be looked over and verified before making changes permanant or possibly available to all user or to the main master repository.
