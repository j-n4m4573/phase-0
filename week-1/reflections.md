#1.1 Think About Time Reflection
	Which time management and productivityÂ ideas did you learn about?

		I learned/relearned about meditation, mindfulness, fixed vs growth mindsets, tiny habits, flow, timeboxing and getting into flow. I was able to briefly review each system because I already had some familiarity with each or a similar system. The two that I decided to dig a little deeper on were meditation and flow. Being a fan of defused learning and how the subconscious plays a role in overall performance and long term procedural learning(as opposed to declarative), I felt the need to dig and try to solidify or further my understanding because I know eventually I will need this.

	What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

		Time boxing is setting aside a specific amount of time just to compete one specific task. I think this is the same method tony robins uses but he actually calls it segmenting. In Tony Robins method he breaks down big arduous tasks into smaller tasks, then sets aside time to complete the smaller pieces, its definitely an effective system. 

	How do you manage your time currently? Currently I use tiny habits/habit stacking in the morning I meditate, hydrate, then reflect on whats the most important thing I can get done for the day. Once I figure out the most important thing I try to get to that thing as soon as possible, then try to prioritize the other obligations in order based on level of significance. Other time management tools I use are time tracking and pomodoros. I just recently bought an app that times pomodorros then tracks them in a calendar so you can see what output and frequency you've been putting in for the month or year. 

	Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
		I would have to say that my current strategy is working its just that sometimes I do get lazy and lose focus or get stuck watching an interesting video or reading too many post online, but overall I would have to say that I get quiet a lot done within the course of the day, even though it hasn't always been this way( actually took years). 

	Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
		Yes, I definitely will employ many if not most of these systems. It depends on the task at hand, the length of time, and the difficulty of the task to be handled. Each system has its strong points and weak points. But in one way or another I probably will use elements of nearly all these systems to try to get the most out of DBC. I will use tiny habits to make sure I get deliberate practice on things that need continuos work, time boxing on things that need deliberate focus, meditation and mindfulness to keep a clear mind and encourage defused learning, pommodoros to combat mental fatigue, and always keep a growth perspective, a belief that I can alway get better no matter how difficult things get.
