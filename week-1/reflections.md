#1.1 Think About Time Reflection
	Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?

		I learned/relearned about meditation, mindfulness, fixed vs growth mindsets, tiny habits, flow, timeboxing and getting into flow. I was able to briefly review each system because I already had some familiarity with each or a similar system. The two that I decided to dig a little deeper on were meditation and flow. Being a fan of defused learning and how the subconscious plays a role in overall performance and long term procedural learning(as opposed to declarative), I felt the need to dig and try to solidify or further my understanding because I know eventually I will need this.

	What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

		Time boxing is setting aside a specific amount of time just to compete one specific task. I think this is the same method tony robins uses but he actually calls it segmenting. In Tony Robins method he breaks down big arduous tasks into smaller tasks, then sets aside time to complete the smaller pieces, its definitely an effective system. 

	How do you manage your time currently? Currently I use tiny habits/habit stacking in the morning I meditate, hydrate, then reflect on whats the most important thing I can get done for the day. Once I figure out the most important thing I try to get to that thing as soon as possible, then try to prioritize the other obligations in order based on level of significance. Other time management tools I use are time tracking and pomodoros. I just recently bought an app that times pomodorros then tracks them in a calendar so you can see what output and frequency you've been putting in for the month or year. 

	Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
		I would have to say that my current strategy is working its just that sometimes I do get lazy and lose focus or get stuck watching an interesting video or reading too many post online, but overall I would have to say that I get quiet a lot done within the course of the day, even though it hasn't always been this way( actually took years). 

	Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
		Yes, I definitely will employ many if not most of these systems. It depends on the task at hand, the length of time, and the difficulty of the task to be handled. Each system has its strong points and weak points. But in one way or another I probably will use elements of nearly all these systems to try to get the most out of DBC. I will use tiny habits to make sure I get deliberate practice on things that need continuos work, time boxing on things that need deliberate focus, meditation and mindfulness to keep a clear mind and encourage defused learning, pommodoros to combat mental fatigue, and always keep a growth perspective, a belief that I can alway get better no matter how difficult things get. 
#1.2 The Command Line Reflection
What is a shell? What is “bash?"
		A shell is a bare bones system without a graphical interface that pretty much preforms all of the regular functions/tasks of our computer like windows or OS X operating systems, but without the visual representation. You can create files, folders, documents, or delete, reorganize files, folders or documents, only difference is that the functions are executed by text commands instead of clicks on a mouse. 

	2	What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
		As a concrete random learner that learns from doing and experimenting, watching the video was the hardest part, especially on parts that were hard to follow along or parts that were too complex or beyond or current scope to understand. Being a fan of linux, I was excited to learn all I could about the shell, but I found that the video had too many holes and did not throughly explain many of the commands and what they meant, instead of just what they did. 

	3	Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
		Yes, out of the ones that were listed, and I learned a few from the video like less, head and a few others. 

	4	In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?In my opinion the most important commands are the basics; mkdir, touch, rmdir, and cd because they are pretty common commands that we will probably be using over and over everyday.
	5	Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

pwd - print working directory - shows your location in the shell, what directory you are in.
-ls - list contents of the directory. Shows contents of the directory.
-mv - move - moves contents of the directory from one directory to another or rewrites the name of the file if in the same directory.
-cd - change directories - switch to new directory. 
-../ - move up a directory
-touch - create a file - makes a text file
-mkdir - make directory - makes a directory
-less - lets you read small segments of a text file, lets you scroll through, forward and backward, unlike the more command. 
-rmdir - remove directory - deletes a folder, may need a -r flag, recursive function if the folder has contents in it.
-rm - remove file - deletes file
-help - gets you help - helps you 

#1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?

		To create a new repo I would have them click the plus sign in the upper right hand corner and select new repository, then name the repository, mark level of privacy, and choose wether they wanted to initialize the repository on github or on the remote, then click create. For forking I would have them click on the fork, then navigate to their personal github page to see if it completed. To clone I would have them navigate to the fork on there personal page and copy/double click the the address under http on the bottom right corner of the page. 

		What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

		 I did not have any struggles setting up git and/or github, I was already slightly familiar with setting up, initializing and adding from a remote. What I learned through the process of setting everthing up was that github can be easy to use if you understand and remember the basics and ask or type help when you get stuck.

		 How does tracking and adding changes make developers' lives easier?

		 It makes developers lives easier first because it helps them to remember what has occured on the branch or master and it tracks what has been done and when it has been done, which is helpful if there is a problem or if for any reason they need to backtrack and go with an earlier version that worked better. 

		What is a commit?
		A commit is the transfering of files from the remote to the repository or possibly could be the opposite, after files are staged and ready to be added. 

		What are the best practices for commit messages? 
		The best practices are to use the first line as a subject line, like an email. And the proceeding lines should be a brief (under 72 characters) description about the work that needs to be carried out. 
		
		What does the HEAD^ argument mean?
		The head argument means the last commit in the sequence. 

		What are the 3 stages of a git change and how do you move a file from one stage to the other?
		The three stages of a git change are staging prepping and commiting . You move a file from one stage to the other by calling the commands on the command line. 

		Write a handy cheatsheet of the commands you need to commit your changes?
		
		git status, git add, git ci -m

		What is a pull request and how do you create and merge one?
		A pull request is a request for your changes to be merged with the master repository.

		Why are pull requests preferred when working with teams?
		Pull request are preffered because they can be looked over and verified before making changes permanant or possibly available to all user or to the main master repository.
