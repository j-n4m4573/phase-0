		<h1>Mark's Snippet</h1>
			<p>
				Let's say I am a sculptor and I am working on a massive marble sculpture of myself. I am chipping away at this marble, shaping a far more muscular version of myself. But something goes wrong. I back up and realize that my biceps are way too small. It's a disaster. If I had version control, I could revert the statue back to a time when I had not yet sculpted the arms. I could even revert the stone to it's original giant slab of marble. I could go back and control whichever version of the project I wanted. But I don't have version control, because stone is not digital, and I am left to wallow in my own unique concoction of vanity and sorrow.
