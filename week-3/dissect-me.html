		<h1>Mark's Snippet</h1>
			<p>
				Let's say I am a sculptor and I am working on a massive marble sculpture of myself. I am chipping away at this marble, shaping a far more muscular version of myself. But something goes wrong. I back up and realize that my biceps are way too small. It's a disaster. If I had version control, I could revert the statue back to a time when I had not yet sculpted the arms. I could even revert the stone to it's original giant slab of marble. I could go back and control whichever version of the project I wanted. But I don't have version control, because stone is not digital, and I am left to wallow in my own unique concoction of vanity and sorrow.

<!--
	What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	We used section, main, h1, body, p and head. We used these because they are web standard for html 5 and they clearly mark the sections you are working in and provide you with the functions that you can use with the given tags i.e the head can contain linking info etc. 

	How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
	Elements get laid out on a page in their hierarchical order, based on level of significance or importance. The browser displays the most important elements first then the others, i.e head, then body, the the sections. 

	What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
	We learned that sublime is fun and easy to use and is going to make our lives a whole lot easier when we start coding massive amounts. In the future we will definitely be researching more snippets because they make your life a whole lot easier.
