#3.4 Chrome Dev Tools

How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?  


You can use chrome devtools inspector to test out different positionings and to check if new formating will conflict with the elements or values already set on the css or html.  


How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?  

You can easily resize elements on the dom using css by adjusting their margins. By resizing their margins you essentially change the amount of space shown in the dom, and essentially show less of an image or element.  


What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?  


The differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative are fixed is a fixed position that stays put, static stays in place no matter how the page is scrolled and relative positions the element relative to the rest of the elements on the page.  


What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?  


The differences between margin, border and padding are that margin creates space around the whole element, a border creates a space or a fill around the padding and content, and padding creates space around the content.  


What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?) Overall this challenge was pretty fun. I enjoyed working with the chrome tool it was interesting to see what different commands did to the elements in the page.
