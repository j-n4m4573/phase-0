**What is an integer? What is a float?**  

An integer is a whole number and a float is a floating point number, basically a number with a decimal.  

**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**    

The difference between float and integer division is that integer division divides whole numbers while float division divides the whole number and also the fraction of the number. So if you were dividing 33.3 /11 float division would calculate the whole number and also consider the .3 of the number.
