**What does puts do?**  


Puts, the put s command, prints the string to the console but does not actually return a value.     


**What is an integer? What is a float?**   


An integer is a whole number and a float is a floating point number, basically a number with a decimal.    


**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**    


The difference between float and integer division is that integer division divides whole numbers while float division divides the whole number and also the fraction of the number. So if you were dividing 33.3 /11 float division would calculate the whole number and also consider the .3 of the number.  

   Mini Challenges
 ```
  year = 365  
  day = 24 

  year * day = 8760
 
```  
```
decade = 10
hours_a_year = 8760
min_an_hour = 
hours_a_year * decade * min_an_hour = 5,256,000
 ```
**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**  



Ruby handles the addition, subtraction multiplication and division of numbers the same way that a calculator does except it also lets you assign words to numerical values so that you can multiply the words instead of the actual integer numbers.   


**What is the difference between integers and floats?**  


The difference between integers and floats is that an integer is a normal whole number, while a float is a floating point number which may contain a fractional value of  a number.   



**What is the difference between integer and float division?**  


The difference between integer and float division is that integer division only returns values that are of the integer flavor meaning that only whole numbers will be computated, while float division will return a floating point number with the fractional value of a number if one is present.     


**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**  


Strings are simple strings of text and you would use them to communicate the meanining or to store the meanining of things by creating lables for them.   
  

**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**  

Local variables are variables that are alive and living only within the scope of the method or block with which they are contained in. 

**How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**  

This challenge was pretty fun (except the reflection lol), I did get a good review of the basics and also learned a few new things.
