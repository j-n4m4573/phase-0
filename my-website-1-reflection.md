Describe what open source means.
open source means free use open license, granting permission and rights to reproduce or adapt or to build on the code as you please.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think open source is great, without it we would not have many of the technologies we have today, like linux and git(just read about this one), thanks to people like linus, who didnt restrict the rights to use or charge people hefty fees for every use or adaptation of the software. 

Assess the importance of using licenses.
using licenses is important if you are interested in making money. Because if a licenses is not in place to prohibit the use or copying of your technologies there are little incentives to pay for the software. 

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with? git push, clone, merge, and commit were all solidified in this challenge, once again the biggest thing I had a challenge with was writing this reflection because it was time consuming and writing is not my strong suit. 
Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.- the docs, man pages.
